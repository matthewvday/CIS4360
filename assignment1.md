# Blog on "Innovation Insights for Microservices"
## Matthew Day

The Gartner paper Innovation Insights for Microservices is directed towards businesses that might be interested in adopting MSA. It goes into great detail on the advantages and disadvantages of moving towards Microservices, strongly leaning towards discouraging most businesses from adopting it. While microservices have many incredible advantages, most importantly CD, it is a form of architecture that is not easily shifted to. 

From what little I knew on Microservices before I was surprised reading this paper. I never knew what a large transition some companies would have to make to to successfully adopt MSA. One part that stood out to me was their prediction that "By 2022, 70% of organizations that attempt to adopt microservices will have found the effort too disruptive and will have switched to miniservices instead." It appear most of these companies are stuck in their ways. While the benefits of MSA might be worth it in the long for some, I guess the idea of restarting from scratch seems more trouble than it's worth at that moment.

The paper goes on to supply a checklist of sorts for companies that might be interested in microservices to consider before committing to MSA.Some of the crucial points that might be most important to consider are developing brand new data management strategies and operations teams employing new practices. It recommends miniservices as an alternative to microservices for businesses not prepared to make all these changes.

Another bit of the paper I found interesting was it's point that people often misinterpret what a microservice is. On a microservices reusablity it states, "Something that is designed for reuse is a service, not a microservice. Reuse creates dependencies that reduce independence and impact agility, therefore reuse is an antipattern in the microservices paradigm." I'm glad they mentioned this because my naive understanding of a microservice was that reusability was one of MSA's strongpoints.
